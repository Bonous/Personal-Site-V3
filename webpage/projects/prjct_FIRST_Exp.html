            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">Because it is difficult to summarize four years of mechanical robotics experience I will be focusing on my favourite part, intakes.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">My favourite part of FIRST robots is how they interact with the year's game piece, and it all starts at the intake. During my years on the team, I often played the main role in intake 
            development. A few key features for our intakes are the “you touch it, you own it” mentality. We wanted to have full control over every game piece we touched. The 2nd is ease of use, by making the intake larger than the game piece it makes the precision required to intake pieces much lower and hence easier for the driver. The other few are very straightforward, durable, lightweight, and consistent.</p>
            <br>
            <img class="project-image" src="../../assets/project-assets/frc2019/intake_2020robot.png" alt="" width="800px">
            <figcaption class="project-figure-caption">Fig.1 - 2020 Robot Intake</figcaption>
            <br>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">In 2020 the game pieces were “power cells”, 7” diameter foam balls. These balls had to be shot and scored into high goals. For this game, we were allowed to hold up to five balls at a time. After evaluating the game we decided to stick to the classic “you touch it, you own it” mentality”, the idea that as soon as you touch the game piece you have complete control of it. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">The front roller had a width of approximately 28” which allowed for multiple balls to be controlled at once. The extra width also made it much easier for the driver to intake balls. The intake featured custom mecanum vectored Intake wheels that would direct the ball to the right side of the robot upon contact. The intake rollers were driven by a 775 brushed DC motor connected to a VersaPlanetery gearbox. The intake was actuated in and out of the robot's frame by two 6” pneumatic cylinders.</p>

            <figcaption class="project-figure-caption">Fig.2 - 2019 Robot Intake</figcaption>
            <br>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">In 2019 the game piece was “cargo”, a 13” diameter dodgeball. These balls had to be scored into towers 7ft in the air. For this game, we were only allowed to hold one cargo at a time so. After evaluating the game we decided to stick to the classic “you touch it, you own it” mentality”, the idea that as soon as you touch the game piece you have complete control of it.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">The intake consisted of a main ABS roller that spanned approximately 20” which helped reduce the accuracy needed to intake the ball. This roller was driven by a 775 brushed DC motor connected to a VersaPlanetery gearbox. Intake was deployed in and out of the robot by two mini CIM motors connected to custom gearboxes. The position of the intake was tracked by a  potentiometer connected to the output shaft of the gearbox. The intake also had a limit switch bumper on the inside to detect the presence of a ball.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">I was present in all steps of the design process. In ideation, I helped brainstorm and develop a priority list for our subsystem. During prototyping, I led the development of one of the potential shooter designs which would later be used on the final robot. For both the shooter and intake I designed parts and worked on assemblies in Solidworks. I machined parts using tools such as milling machines, lathes, and 3D printers.</p>
